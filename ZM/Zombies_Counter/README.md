### How to use
1. Navigate to the T6 Plutonium Folder by pressing `Win+R` and pasting `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6` into it, and hitting Ok.
2. Create a folder called `scripts`, then inside that folder, create two new folders called `mp`, and `zm`.
3. Take the compiled script and put it in `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm`.
